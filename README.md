**GrooveLink** is a backend module that helps users find artists similar to those in their vinyl collections. 

It focuses on:
- Accepting a user’s favorite artist (from their collection)
- Recommending similar artists using Spotify and Last.fm metadata
- Using genre, popularity, and follower count to compare artist profiles

The interactive UI is developed by other teammates — this repository powers the artist similarity engine.
